# ‚ú® So you want to sponsor a contest

This `README.md` contains a set of checklists for our contest collaboration.

Your contest will use two repos: 
- **a _contest_ repo** (this one), which is used for scoping your contest and for providing information to contestants (wardens)
- **a _findings_ repo**, where issues are submitted. (We'll set that one up later.) 

Ultimately, when we launch the contest, this contest repo will be made public and will contain the smart contracts to be reviewed and all the information needed for contest participants. The findings repo will be made public after the contest is over and your team has mitigated the identified issues.

Some of the checklists in this doc are for **C4 (üê∫)** and some of them are for **you as the contest sponsor (‚≠êÔ∏è)**.

# Contest prep

## üê∫ C4: Contest prep
- [x] Rename this repo to reflect contest date (if applicable)
- [x] Rename contest H1 below
- [x] Add link to report form in contest details below
- [x] Update pot sizes
- [x] Fill in start and end times in contest bullets below.
- [ ] Move any relevant information in "contest scope information" above to the bottom of this readme.
- [x] Add matching info to the [code423n4.com public contest data here](https://github.com/code-423n4/code423n4.com/blob/main/_data/contests/contests.csv))
- [ ] Delete this checklist.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Contest prep
- [ ] Make sure your code is thoroughly commented using the [NatSpec format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.10/natspec-format.html#natspec-format).
- [ ] Modify the bottom of this `README.md` file to describe how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevent documentation and any other criteria/details that the C4 Wardens should keep in mind when reviewing. ([Here's a well-constructed example.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/main/README.md))
- [ ] Please have final versions of contracts and documentation added/updated in this repo **no less than 8 hours prior to contest start time.**
- [ ] Ensure that you have access to the _findings_ repo where issues will be submitted.
- [ ] Promote the contest on Twitter (optional: tag in relevant protocols, etc.)
- [ ] Share it with your own communities (blog, Discord, Telegram, email newsletters, etc.)
- [ ] Optional: pre-record a high-level overview of your protocol (not just specific smart contract functions). This saves wardens a lot of time wading through documentation.
- [ ] Designate someone (or a team of people) to monitor DMs & questions in the C4 Discord (**#questions** channel) daily (Note: please *don't* discuss issues submitted by wardens in an open channel, as this could give hints to other wardens.)
- [ ] Delete this checklist and all text above the line below when you're ready.

[ ‚≠êÔ∏è SPONSORS ADD INFO HERE ]

# Contest Scope
This contest is open for one week. Representatives from Sushi will be available in the Code Arena Discord to answer any questions during the contest period. The focus for the contest is to try and find any logic errors or ways to drain funds from any of the contracts in a way that is advantageous for an attacker at the expense of users. Wardens should assume that governance variables are set sensibly (unless they can find a way to change the value of a governance variable, and not counting social engineering approaches for this).

# Codebase

The full codebase may be found in this repository: https://github.com/sushiswap/miso

# Documentation and special attention

A general documentation explaining the backgrounds of MISO may be found here: https://instantmiso.gitbook.io/miso/dev/token-factory-smart-contract/sushi-token-smart-contract, any contracts in the MISO repository are in scope. 
A short introduction to the most important contract is to be found below:

# Access Control

## Miso Access Controls

Utilizes OpenZeppelin Access Control to granularly control admin controls for auctions and factories.

## PointList

Allows for WhiteListing of Participants by setting commitment amounts per account.

# Auctions
## Dutch Auction
Implementation of a dutch auction with a linearly falling price, with commitments being able to be made in tokens or ETH. 

## Hyperbolic Auction

Implementation of an auction with a price following a price curve, with commitments being able to be made in tokens or ETH. 

## Batch Auction

The batch auction collects funds for a specified period of time and then redistributes the tokens percentually according to the size of the commitments.

## Crowdsale

The Miso crowdsale allows the sale of tokens at a fixed price in ETH or tokens.

# Post Auction Launcher

Allows to launch liquidity to SushiSwap after a successful sale.
